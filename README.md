*The sole purpose of this project is to develop a method for providing personalized career guidance to a college fresher.<br />
*A web application called Aide4U has been developed . <br />
*It provides comprehensive career guidance to freshers who have a lot to explore but very limited time.<br />
*For this project, a survey was conducted in computer science and allied branches at the college, focusing on Computer Science Engineering students. <br />
*The dataset contains 1000 data points along with 16 attributes.<br />
*To provide career path recommendations, a deep learning model called Friends AI was developed. <br />
*It takes both technical and personality attributes as input parameters and suggests a career path based on the experience of a senior student from the college. <br />
*Additionally, Aide4U has other features to ensure the overall grooming of the college students. <br />
*Ultimately, this research and Aide4U will help them become industry-ready by the time they graduate. <br />
*It is suggested to implement this approach for core branches that are not related to computer science as well. <br />
*Hence, Aide4U will help students to achieve more and perform better in their careers.
